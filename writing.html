    <h2>Emptiness and Fullness</h2>
    <p>

        A farmer builds a dam <br>
        
        To be filled with water, <br>
        
        In preperation for the harvest. <br><br>
        
        
        A warrior sharpens his sword, <br>
        
        His body and mind, <br>
        
        In preparation for battle. <br><br>
        
        
        A tiger crouches, and stalks <br>
        
        It's prey <br>
        
        In preperation for the killing bite. <br><br>
        
        
        A difference in charges builds <br>
        
        Released in an instant.<br><br>
        
        Lightning tears through the sky. <br>
        
        Setting the oak ablaze <br><br>
        
        
        Energy accumulates in reserves <br>
        
        To be released at the proper time <br>

        In accordance with the Way <br>

    <h2>2/12 The Ultimate Bondage: Fear of Rejection</h2>
    <p>
       

Most peoples decisions stem from the fear of isolation. <br><br>

Isolation is a primordial fear. In ancient times, it would mean death. <br><br>

So we cover our faces with powder. We say things we don’t mean. We do things we don’t want to do. <br><br>

We do all this to feel accepted by the pack, for the alternative would be isolation and death. <br><br>

But deep down, our true selves yearn to escape this bondage. <br>

We yearn to feel connected to our bodies and our minds. The self, or the soul seeks authenticity. <br><br>

<strong>What would you do if you weren’t afraid? </strong><br><br>

Would you would talk to that person, would you would stand up for yourself. <br>

You would speak as a free man/woman, not as a slave to conformity. <br><br>

How does one conquer this fear? <br>

<strong>Fear grows in the darkness, it shrinks in the light. </strong><br>

When faced head on, it shrinks to the size of a pea.<br><br>

Set small goals. Small victories accumulate to large victories. <br>

Practice saying 'No'. Practice setting boundaries. <br>

You will realise that doing so will ironically eliminate isolation. <br>

Being serounded by people who respect your boundaries, the fake ones will scamper away.

    <h2>2/13 Definition of Human: The animalistic </h2>

    <p>
        What does it mean to be human? <br><br>

Despite our attempts to feel elevated from it, we are no different from the animals we look down upon.<br>

We seek shelter, water and food to survive. <br>

We seek safety in numbers. <br>

We seek to provide value to the group, or risk being cast aside to die. <br>

We seek partners who are strong and skilled hunters. <br>

We seek partners who can bear and nourish children. <br>

Ultimately, we are beings born with a self. We seek to maintain this self just as a knight defends a fortress. <br>

We seek to conquer time by propagating this sense of self to our offspring, in the hope that our self lives on. <br>

<strong>All human decisions revolve around self preservation.</strong><br>

    <h2>2/13 Order and Chaos</h2>
    <p>
        In times of old, we were creatures at the mercy of nature. <br>

We had very little control over plagues, war, and death.<br>

So we invented stories, to create order from chaos.<br>

Just as we glimpsed up at the stars and found patterns in the blackness.<br>



Within ourselves there is a battle raging. <br>

A battle between order and chaos. <br>

When order rules, chaos begins to fester from within. <br>

When chaos rules, there is a yearning for order. <br><br>


Chaos comes in many different forms. <br>

A feminine energy that grows and seeks to break free. <br>

The fire within one's spirit to express, to fight through pain. <br>

The indirect path which can wear down stone. <br>

The intangible and the spiritual. <br>

The spirit of man. <br><br>


Order also emerges in different forms. <br>

The masculine who creates laws and rulebooks. <br>

The desire to feel protected and secure. <br>

The desire to be direct and firm. <br>

The worldly and the realistic. <br>

The body of man. <br><br>


The body contains the spirit, protecting it from the outside invaders. <br>

The spirit guides the body, just as a captain guides a ship. <br>

Each one holds just as much importance as the other. <br>

They are one and the same. <br>

 In constant ebb and flow, like the tides of the sea. <br>

Their battle appears much like a dance, and this battle appears in all things. <br>

There is a battle within the individual, <br>

A battle within individuals, <br>

A battle within groups, <br>

A battle within nations, <br>

A battle within the world. <br>

<strong>The way is not to control chaos and order, but to seek balance.</strong> <br>
