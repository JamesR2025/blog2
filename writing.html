    <h2>Emptiness and Fullness</h2>

        A farmer builds a dam <br>
        
        To be filled with water, <br>
        
        In preperation for the harvest. <br><br>
        
        
        A warrior sharpens his sword, <br>
        
        His body and mind, <br>
        
        In preparation for battle. <br><br>
        
        
        A tiger crouches, and stalks <br>
        
        It's prey <br>
        
        In preperation for the killing bite. <br><br>
        
        
        A difference in charges builds <br>
        
        Released in an instant.<br><br>
        
        Lightning tears through the sky. <br>
        
        Setting the oak ablaze <br><br>
        
        
        Energy accumulates in reserves <br>
        
        To be released at the proper time <br>

        In accordance with the Way <br>

    <h2>2/12 The Ultimate Bondage: Fear of Rejection</h2>
    <p>
       

Most peoples decisions stem from the fear of isolation. <br><br>

Isolation is a primordial fear. In ancient times, it would mean death. <br><br>

So we cover our faces with powder. We say things we don’t mean. We do things we don’t want to do. <br><br>

We do all this to feel accepted by the pack, for the alternative would be isolation and death. <br><br>

But deep down, our true selves yearn to escape this bondage. <br>

We yearn to feel connected to our bodies and our minds. The self, or the soul seeks authenticity. <br><br>

<strong>What would you do if you weren’t afraid? </strong><br><br>

Would you would talk to that person, would you would stand up for yourself. <br>

You would speak as a free man/woman, not as a slave to conformity. <br><br>

How does one conquer this fear? <br>

<strong>Fear grows in the darkness, it shrinks in the light. </strong><br>

When faced head on, it shrinks to the size of a pea.<br><br>

Set small goals. Small victories accumulate to large victories. <br>

Practice saying 'No'. Practice setting boundaries. <br>

You will realise that doing so will ironically eliminate isolation. <br>

Being serounded by people who respect your boundaries, the fake ones will scamper away.
