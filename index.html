    <p>Met an interesting person at Orange Blossom Cafe. Talked about life</p>
    <p>Discovered Kava Social Club, tried kratom for the first time.</p>

        Today is a day for reflection, of staying course.<br>
        Though we can never be certain of the future, we control the now.<br>
        We control the daily steps, the foundation.<br>
        I seek freedom, freedom from attachment. Freedom to create<br>
        To create is the ultimate destiny.<br>
        For God blessed us with hands.<br>
        To harness the flame, to conquor, to bring to life.<br>
        To create, that is my destiny. <br>

        Never to be a slave to the worldly,<br>
        That which will return to the earth and perish, and rot.<br>
        To accept earthly desires as they are, <br>
        Yet to attain to that which is immortal,<br>
        That which is beyond<br>

        To detach from the self.<br>
        To be completely in tune with the world.<br>
        To listen deeply, to understand deeply.<br>
        To feel.<br>
        This is the mark of an invincibile warrior.<br>
        Who is also an artist, a musician.<br>
        The Way lies in all things.<br>
        One is all, The spirit flows within all.<br>
        For when one understands their own energy and the enrgy of the opponent, one is invincible.

        I am in love with simple shapes that capture detail. <br>
        People get too caught up in the details. <br>
        Pick the top three, cut out the rest.<br>
        People, places and things. Prioritize<br>
        The rest are energy vampires<br><br>
        A strong stance is ready to attack and retreat.<br>
        Never overextending, while never being timid<br>
        A perfect balance, is found in perfect positioning<br>
        A strong stance.<br>
        Fighting and life, and art and music: all the same.<br>

        <strong>Got my international driving permit today! Now where to practice riding that motorbike?</strong>
