        Today is a day for reflection, of staying course. 
        Though we can never be certain of the future, we control the now.
        We control the daily steps, the foundation.
        I seek freedom, freedom from attachment. Freedom to create
        To create is the ultimate destiny.
        For God blessed us with hands.
        To harness the flame, to conquor, to bring to life.
        To create, that is my destiny. 

        Never to be a slave to the worldly,
        That which will return to the earth and perish, and rot.
        To accept earthly desires as they are, 
        Yet to attain to that which is immortal,
        That which is beyond

        To detach from the self.
        To be completely in tune with the world.
        To listen deeply, to understand deeply.
        To feel.
        This is the mark of an invincibile warrior.
        Who is also an artist, a musician.
        The Way lies in all things.
        One is all, The spirit flows within all.
